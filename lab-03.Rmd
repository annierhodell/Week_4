# Questioning data visualisations

## Image 1

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Speaking-the-world.jpg")
```

Exercise 1: 
The Chinese bar is thicker rather than longer.
There is an error in the Chinese data, it should say 'Million' instead of 'Billion' as it is implying 1,026,000,000,000 people speak Chinese which is more than the population of Earth.

## Image 2

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rose-pop-density-total-area-bw.jpg")
```

Exercise 2:
The Black and White theme is hard to differentiate between.
We don't know what part of the image shows density or what shows total area (i.e. unlabeled).
No legend or numbers.

## Image 3

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/life-expectancy-rule-of-law.png")
```

Exercise 3:
No legend.
No Title, don't know what the graph is about.
Does size of circle have a meaning?
The overlapping colours makes it hard to differentiate between them. 
No numbers on axes

## Image 4

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/global-income-dist.PNG")
```

Exercise 4:
Some of the colours are for countries and others for area.
Difficult to read the words on top of the graph, a legend would be advised instead. 
Very long axes titles.
Units should be used in axes labels. 
Relatively out of date data.
Gobal income of 2011 but data collected in 2015.

# Exercises

```{r load-data-staff, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
staff <- read_csv("data/instructional-staff.csv")
```


## Exercise 1

What is the difference between *wide format* data and *long format* data?
Wide format data does not have repeats in the first column.

Is the format `staff` data *wide* or *long*?
wide

How many observations are there in the data set?
11



## Exercise 2

```{r pivoting}
## Uncomment and complete the following code

staff_long <- staff %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = !faculty_type , #columns become everything but faculty type
   names_to = "years",
    values_to = "percent"
   )
staff_long
```


## Exercise 3

```{r dot-plot}
ggplot(data = staff_long,
       mapping = aes(x = years, 
                     y = percent, 
                     colour = faculty_type)) +
  geom_point()


```

## Exercise 4

```{r bad-line-plot}
ggplot(data = staff_long,
       mapping = aes(x = years, 
                     y = percent, 
                     colour = faculty_type)) +
  geom_line()

```

## Exercise 5

```{r mutate-year}
## Uncomment and complete the following code

#staff_long <- staff_long %>%
#  mutate(year = ______(year))
```


```{r working-line-plot}
# Write your code for Exercise 5 here



```

## Exercise 6

```{r better-line-plot}
# Write your code for Exercise 6 here




```

## Exercise 7

_Write below your ideas for adapting the line plot_

* Idea 1
* Idea 2
* Idea 3
* ...


## Exercise 8

```{r implement-Ex7}
# Write your code for Exercise 8 here
